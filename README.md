Most sheet music editors are fairly complicated and targeted to experienced music composers.
This minimalistic p5.js editor/player is designed for quickly skething ideas and/or practicing
with music notation exercices. This is an ongoing project. There is a lot of features to be 
implemented to make it as ufeul as I want it to be.

### TODO

- Connect 8th, 16th, and 32nd notes with beam.
- Edit clef, time signature, and notes on the staff.
- Draw measures in custom locations.
