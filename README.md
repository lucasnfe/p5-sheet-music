Most sheet music editors are fairly complicated and targeted at experienced music composers. This minimalistic p5.js editor/player is designed to quickly sketch ideas and/or practice with music notation exercises. This is an ongoing project. There are a lot of features to be implemented to make it as useful as I want it to be.
