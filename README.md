Most sheet music editors are fairly complicated and targeted to experienced music composers.
This minimalistic p5.js editor/player is designed for quickly skething ideas and/or practicing
with music notation exercices. This is an ongoing project. There is a lot of features to be 
implemented to make it as ufeul as I want it to be.
